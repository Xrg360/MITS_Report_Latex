Object detection plays a pivotal role in numerous real-world applications, ranging from autonomous vehicles to medical imaging. In real-time scenarios, both the speed and accuracy of detection are critical. \textbf{You Only Look Once (YOLO)} has emerged as a powerful algorithm for object detection, renowned for its ability to deliver high-speed performance without compromising accuracy. 
% Introduces the topic of object detection and YOLO, highlighting the importance of speed and accuracy. 
% \textbf{} is used to make "You Only Look Once (YOLO)" bold in the final PDF.

The YOLO algorithm divides the input image into a grid, where each cell predicts bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. To ensure the most accurate detection, techniques like non-maximal suppression are applied, refining the selection of the best bounding box for each object. Compared to other models, YOLO consistently outperforms them in terms of both speed and precision, making it highly suitable for real-time tasks where quick and reliable object detection is essential. YOLO's innovative approach drastically improves efficiency, securing its position as a leading algorithm in the field of computer vision.\\[0.5cm]
