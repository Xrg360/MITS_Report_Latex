Object detection is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision, involving both the identification and localization of objects within images or video sequences. Unlike image classification, which assigns a single label to an entire image, object detection aims to detect multiple objects in an image by predicting their class labels and precisely locating them using bounding boxes.\newline

%
YOLO is known for its innovative approach to object detection, offering both high speed and accuracy. Below is a detailed explanation of how the YOLO algorithm works:
% This sentence introduces the "How YOLO Works" section and mentions YOLO's key strengths of speed and accuracy.
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Image Resizing and Grid Division:} YOLO first resizes the input image to a fixed size (e.g., 416x416) for standardization and efficiency. It then splits the image into an S x S grid, where each grid cell is responsible for detecting objects whose centers fall within it.
  % This is the first step in the YOLO process: resizing the image and dividing it into an SxS grid. The text explains how each grid cell detects objects based on their centers.
  %  
  \item \textbf{Bounding Boxes:} Each grid cell predicts B bounding boxes and confidence scores, indicating the likelihood that the box contains an object. Anchor boxes are used to define fixed aspect ratios and scales, enabling the model to better handle objects of varying shapes and sizes.
  % This step describes how each grid cell predicts bounding boxes and their confidence scores. The explanation also introduces anchor boxes for handling different object sizes and shapes.
  %
  \item \textbf{Prediction Generation:} For each bounding box, YOLO predicts:
   \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Coordinates (x, y, w, h): } Center coordinates relative to the grid cell and dimensions relative to the image.
  % This explains that YOLO predicts the center coordinates (x, y) and dimensions (w, h) of each bounding box.
  %  
  \item \textbf{Confidence Score:} Represents the likelihood of an object being present and the accuracy of the box.
  % This defines the confidence score, which indicates how likely the bounding box contains an object and how accurate it is.
  %  
  \item \textbf{Class Probabilities:} Each grid cell predicts class probabilities, conditioned on containing an object.
  % This step mentions that class probabilities are predicted for each bounding box, but only if the grid cell contains an object.
   \end{itemize}
  % This is a nested itemized list within step 3, detailing the specific predictions YOLO makes for each bounding box.
  %
  \item \textbf{Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS):} NMS is used to eliminate duplicate detections, refining the results without significantly affecting performance.
  % The final step explains how Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) is used to remove duplicate bounding boxes and ensure only the best detections are kept.
\end{enumerate}
% This block uses an enumerated list to explain the steps in the YOLO process: resizing and grid division, bounding box prediction, and non-maximum suppression.
